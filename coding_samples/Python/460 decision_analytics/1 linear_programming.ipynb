    "### Question 1\n",
    "SteelCo manufactures three types of steel at two different steel mills.  During a given month, Mill 1 has 200 hours of blast furnace time available, whereas Mill 2 has 300 hours.  Because of differences in the furnaces at each mill, the time and cost to produce a ton of steel differs for each mill and are shown in the following table.  Each month, SteelCo must manufacture a total of at least 400 tons of Steel 1, 500 tons of Steel 2, and 300 tons of Steel 3 to meet demand; however, the total amount of Steel 2 manufactured should not exceed the combined amount of Steel 1 and Steel 3.  Also, in order to maintain a roughly uniform usage of the two mills, managementâ€™s policy is that the percentage of available blast furnace capacity (time) used at each mill should be the same. That is, the relative rates of usage should be equivalent, not the absolute usage. Clearly formulate a linear program (LP) to minimize the cost of manufacturing the desired steel."

    "A company wants to plan production for the ensuing year to minimize the combined cost of production and inventory costs.  In each quarter of the year, demand is anticipated to be 130, 160, 250, and 150 units, respectively.  The plant can produce a maximum of 200 units each quarter.  The product can be manufactured at a cost of $15 per unit during the first quarter, however the manufacturing cost is expected to rise by $1 per quarter.  Excess production can be stored from one quarter to the next at a cost of $1.50 per unit, but the storage facility can hold a maximum of 60 units.  How should the production be scheduled so as to minimize the total costs?"
